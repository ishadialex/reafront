              <p>
                As part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen operational integrity, enhance transactional security, and maintain a transparent financial ecosystem across our rental arbitrage investment platform, we are implementing an important update to our Withdrawal and Processing Fee Policy.
              </p>

              <p>
                Effective immediately, processing fees will no longer be automatically deducted from investor returns or monthly payouts. To comply with upgraded security standards, regulatory alignment practices, and fraud-prevention protocols, all processing fees must now be paid separately by investors prior to initiating any withdrawal request.
              </p>

                  Why This Change Is Necessary
                </h4>
                <p className="mb-3">This adjustment is part of a broader system enhancement designed to:</p>
                <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
                  <li>Increase platform security and reduce unauthorized or high-risk withdrawal attempts.</li>
                  <li>Ensure clear financial tracking, separating operational fees from investor profit allocations.</li>
                  <li>Improve compliance with evolving digital transaction verification standards.</li>
                  <li>Maintain structural transparency in all investor-related disbursements.</li>
                  <li>Support long-term sustainability of our rental arbitrage infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>
                These improvements enable us to continue providing predictable returns, faster processing times, and stronger oversight over the full withdrawal lifecycle.
